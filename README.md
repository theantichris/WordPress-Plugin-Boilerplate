# WordPress Plugin Framework

My own framework for making the WordPress plugins the way I do.

The main plugin class is a Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance created.

Includes blank methods for activation, deactivation, and registering scripts and styles.

The base class sets up the text domain for internationalization and localization. Just drop your i18n and l10n files into the lang directory.

A blank uninstall file is included and setup correctly to make sure it is only called from the WordPress dashboard.

All custom plugin functionality should be placed in the run_plugin() method.

When instantiating an object such as Custom_Post_Type or Taxonomy save it to the appropriate array property on the main class.

Ex.: $this->custom_post_types[ 'new_custom_post_type' ] = Custom_Post_Type( $plural_post_type_name, $capabilities, $support, $menu_icon )

## Custom Post Types

You can create a custom post type through the CustomPostType object. The class accepts optional arguments for post capabilities (array), post support ( array ), and menu icon (string). If nothing is specified they are set to the WordPress default

Create new custom post types in the main plugin class constructor.

Ex.: $new_post_type = new Custom_Post_Type( $plural_post_type_name, $capabilities, $support, $menu_icon );

## Taxonomies

Taxonomies can be added to post types by creating a Custom_Taxonomy object. The $post_types parameter is options and will use "post" if not specified, it will accept a string or array of strings.

Ex.: $new_taxonomy = new Custom_Taxonomy( $plural_taxonomy_name, $post_types );

### Terms

You can add terms to a Custom_Taxonomy object by using the add_terms() method. It accepts a single parameter that can either be a string or array of strings.

Ex.: $new_taxonomy->add_terms( $terms );

## Pages

You can create new dashboard pages by using the Menu_Page, Object_Page, Utility_Page, Sub_Menu_Page, and Options_Page classes.

The only required fields are $page_title and $view_path with the exception of $parent_slug which is only required for Sub_Menu_Page.

All pages use the View object to echo the HTML.

To add a top level menu page use the Menu_Page class.

Ex.: $menu_page = new Menu_Page( $page_title, $view_path, $capability = 'manage_options, $icon_url = null, $position = null, $view_data = array(), $parent_slug = null )

### Removing Pages

You can remove a page using the remove_page( $page_slug ) method.

## View

There is a View class provide to introduce some MVC functionality to the framework and make it simpler to create pages. To create a view place a PHP file into the /views/ directory that displays the HTML.

Assign the path to the file to $view_path. If you need to pass any data to the View assign it to an associative array to the $view_data property.

Ex.: View::render( $view_path, $view_data = null )

## Settings
You can create options for your plugin using the Settings class.

Ex.:
$setting = new Settings( $page_slug ); // Creates the settings object with the slug of the page. This could be a default page or one you create.
$setting->add_section( 'My Section', $view ); // Creates the settings section your options will be grouped under. The view will contain the header for the section.
$setting->add_field( 'My Field', $view ); // Creates the field and adds it to the section. The view needs to contain the input field for the option.

## Helper Functions

Some helper functions are included in the main plugin class. They are public, static functions so can be used anywhere.

### print_to_log()

Writes a message to debug.log in the wp-content folder if you have the wp-config.php setup to do that. It will accept any variable or string.

Ex.: WordPress_Plugin_Framework::print_to_log( $message_to_send ).

### make_singular()

Takes a plural string and makes it singular.

Ex.: $singular_string = WordPress_Plugin_Framework::make_singular( $plural_string );

### make_slug()

Takes a string and makes a WordPress slug by replacing spaces with hyphens and making all letters lower case.

Ex.: $slug = WordPress_Plugin_Framework::make_slug( $string );
